<br>I'm really excited to share that I've been offered a position as a Computer Scientist for the FAA!<br><br>

I am so grateful for this opportunity and excited to utilize my skills to assist the country on a local and national level!<br><br>

This is a huge step forward in my career and I see nothing but goodness ahead.<br><br>
That aside, I recently finished "Decision Sprint" by Atif Rafiq and I really enjoyed it.<br><br>
I like to see it as the spiritual successor to Jeff Sutherland's "Scrum" as it continues<br><br>
with the same methodology but gives more of a perspective on application.<br><br>
The book has now been added to my library, check it out!
