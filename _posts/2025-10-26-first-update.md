<br>What have I been doing lately? Lots of self improvement. I've been reading a ton, and simultaneously
taking a bunch of courses to brush up my skills. I recently finished two books:<br><br>

**The Harvard Business Review Guide to Emotional Intelligence**<br><br>

**Scrum by Jeff Sutherland, J.J. Sutherland**<br><br>


Although I have been privy of scrum/agile methodology for some time, I was recommended to read it to get
a new perspective on leadership and I'm not disappointed.<br><br>

I found it super informative and helpful to refer to even outside of tech.
